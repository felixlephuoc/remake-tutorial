```{r init, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
if (!exists("ragout")) remake::create_bindings()
```

Look at the ragout I made today:

```{r}
ragout
```

I combined fried meat and vegetables:

```{r}
fried_meat
cooked_potatoes
peeled_carrots
```

Some of the components were more difficult to prepare than others:

```{r}
plot(
  factor(c("Fried meat", "Cooked potatoes", "Peeled carrots")),
  sapply(
    list(fried_meat, cooked_potatoes, peeled_carrots),
    function(x) length(format(x))
  )
)
```
