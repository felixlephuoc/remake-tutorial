# Further steps

- Use `remake` for your own data analysis projects, or with an artificial but "real" data project

- Check out [`parallelRemake`](https://github.com/wlandau/parallelRemake) by Will Landau
    - A tool that converts `remake.yml` to a `Makefile` proper

- Check out [`remakeGenerator`](https://github.com/wlandau/remakeGenerator) by Will Landau
    - A tool that writes `remake.yml` files

- Check out [`drake`](https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake) by Will Landau
    - A fresh successor to `remake` that specifies workflows using data frames and not `.yml` files

- Submit [issues](https://github.com/krlmlr/remake-tutorial/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/krlmlr/remake-tutorial/pulls) to this tutorial if you have found mistakes or omissions.
